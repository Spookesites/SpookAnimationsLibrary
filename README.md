# Spook Animations Library

Spook Animations Library is a lightweight JavaScript library for adding animations to your website.

## Instalaci√≥n

You can download the library directly from GitHub or clone the repository using Git:


```sh
git clone https://github.com/TU_USUARIO/animations-js.git
```
Or you can download the script from GitHub and include it in your HTML file:
```html
<script src="path/to/animations.js"></script>
```
*Also, make sure to include the CSS file that defines the animations and effects:*
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="ruta/a/animations.css">
```
## Functions
The different functions included in the library are described below:

# `scrollAnimation(element, animationClass)`

Adds an animation class to an element when it is visible in the browser window during scrolling.

- element: The HTML element to which the animation class will be added.
- animationClass: the CSS class that defines the animation.

Example: 
```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.my-element');
scrollAnimation(element, 'animate');
```

In your HTML file, add a CSS class that defines the animation you want to add:
```css
.animate {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(100px);
  transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
.animate.visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}

```
Then, in your JavaScript file, use the scrollAnimation function to add the animation class when the element becomes visible:
```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.my-element');
scrollAnimation(element, 'animate');
```
# `function scrollEffect(element, effectClass, effectValue)`
In this example, we'll add a CSS effect when an element becomes visible during scrolling.

In your JavaScript file, use the scrollEffect function to apply the CSS effect when the element becomes visible:
```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.my-element');
scrollEffect(element, 'background-color', '#f00');
```
# `function loadAnimation(element, animationClass)`
In this example, we'll add an animation when the page is loaded.

In your HTML file, add a CSS class that defines the animation you want to add:
```css
.animate {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(100px);
  transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
.animate.visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```
Then, in your JavaScript file, use the loadAnimation function to add the animation class when the page is loaded:
```javascript
const element = document.querySelector('.my-element');
loadAnimation(element, 'animate');
```
